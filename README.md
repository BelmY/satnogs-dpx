More information about filter in report and qucs project files.

Repository includes all source files for PCB's qucs, simulation files and reports about the filter 
specifications.

## Repository policy
SatNOGS hardware repositories only track source design files. All needed derivative files (e.g. grb etc) 
for production are created per release, packaged in an archive and uploaded linked to a  [release](https://github.com/satnogs/satnogs-diplexer/releases).

Each major release (x.0.0) is branched out of master. Subsequent fixes (minor or not) are commited on those branches and tagged accordingly.

Master branch is most times under active development, so expect things to break. For production ready and previous releases source files check tags and branches.
